                    <p>We built the future we wanted to see.
                    We saw students going hungry and living out of cars. Then
                        we saw students with large college debt who struggled to find employment.
                        So we built a platform that does more than just help with learning. It helps students earn
                        an income both in the short term and long. Then it gives them a concrete way to prove
                        their work ethic and knowledge to future employers.  </p>

                <p>The top three college student problems are grades, money, and jobs.
                    Let's face it. Wouldn't it be great if there was a platform that could somehow provide
                    a solution? Well finally there is. It's called TopScholars.

                <p> TopScholars considers learning a first-class citizen and not an
                    afterthought. Its algorithms employ the best learning methods found in recent research
                    conducted at a top 5 university (Go Gators). You can use TopScholars in all your classes.

                <p> This is brilliant!
                    Since you’re already creating study materials, then you might as
                    well get paid for them. On TopScholars you're paid *100% of what you earned minus
                    minor credit card fees. And another thing, when you allow others to share your deck,
                    you can continue to earn long after you’ve taken the course. This is known as
                    "passive recurring revenue".
                    Now it's literally possible to earn while learning.

                <p> When you've earned from your knowledge it serves as a crowd-sourced agreement that the material
                    you've studied has value. This combined with metrics from creating and studying becomes verifiable
                    credibility you can show through a QR-Code. When you're competing for the top paying jobs,

                    compared to a credit score for knowledge. And that's much better than a grade.</p>

                <p> Tired of wrong or outdated answers? Other companies don't give much credit to the creators of data.
                    Thus, when you ask for something for free, you get what you pay for. We are not criticizing them,
                    but it seems misaligned. On TopScholars, students keep 100% of what they earn, and it also helps
                    associate their knowledge expertise. Better rewards for better data means you can find better answers.
