                                            vetting a candidates potential as a competent and productive employee. A KnocScore is essentially
                                            a credit score for Knowledge. It uses an
                                            unbiased, crowd-sourced means to rate the value of the data you are studying. This is combined
                                            with time spent interacting with the same data. Later capabilities may be combined with
                                            the type of recall that is used. This gives an employer an even perspective that is outside
                                            of biased and potentially corrupted outcomes. Learn more about <a href="/knowledge-credibility-score">

                                            means for an employer to verify that 1. You have a good work ethic based on the
                                            time spent studying information. 2. That you are knowledgeable in relevant domains.
                                            3. That you were willing to take initiative to create metrics about your competency.
                                            Few employers will ask you what your grades were. However, knowing your potential as
                                            an employee is a far better metric than a grade.
