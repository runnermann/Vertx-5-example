                        <h3 class="act-like-h1 mb-4">Simple explanation</h3>
                        <p>KnocScore is a credit Score for knowledge. Just as a credit score reflects an individual's
                            financial reliability when applying for a loan, KnocScore reflects a professional's proven
                            abilities within their field. When seeking employment, a higher KnocScore translates to
                            superior performance capabilities, leading to better job prospects and terms. For instance,
                            professionals with a higher KnocScore are more competitive and should have greater
                            opportunities for career growth, increased responsibilities, and larger salary offers.

                                    Such information can be difficult to capture, but through some abstractions and judgment we can
                                    allow separate standards as long as it is understood appropriately. Thus, categories provides understanding and
                                    allows the use of concrete and non-concrete capture methods while providing understanding of its
                                    guarantee to prevent false values such as false claims. <span class="act-like-h4">Categories are a vote of confidence

                                    KnocScore point system is non-standard. KnocScore incentives repetition and awards higher
                                    points for free-recall based questions. It also differs from a standard point system in that it
                                    deducts points when a question is answered incorrectly. Repeat questions when answered correctly
                                    will make up for the lost points. In some cases more points can be earned from repeat questions.
                                    Points should be considered as interaction with knowledge. In general a higher number indicates
                                    greater interaction and free-recall has been shown to be the strongest for memory retention.
