                    <p>
                        The KnocScore functions similarly to a credit score but focuses on evaluating an individual's
                        knowledge and competence within a particular field. Developed to provide a standardized assessment
                        of professional expertise, the KnocScore offers a tangible way to demonstrate proficiency and
                        authority in specific knowledge domains. This score can be particularly influential during job
                        applications, promotions, and professional networking.

                    <h3>Profile Building and Enhancement</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Create a Comprehensive Profile:</b> Creating a great impression with your KnocScore will mean
                        that you will want to ensure that your KnocScore is thorough, reflecting all your verifiable
                        qualifications, certifications, and achievements are listed. Stay up to date by signing up as

                    <p>
                        <b>Active Engagement:</b> Participate in forums and discussions within your field. This is a great
                        way to gain peer recognition and post about your qualifications. If you write articles or blogs,
