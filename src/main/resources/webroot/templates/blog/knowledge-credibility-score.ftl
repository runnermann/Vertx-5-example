                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In today’s work environment there are many problems that continue to permeate division and belief
                        that the system is unfair. Employers appear to be biased based on race, religion, sex, and a slew
                        of other reasons. We do not portend that these problems exist, rather we offer an abstraction
                        between capability and the individual. In the world of business, particularly for small ones,
                        its ultimately what an individual brings to the table that matters. What is their work ethic,
                        are they capable of completing their job, and do they have good moral composition, rather, can
                        they be trusted.  There is little to answer these questions from the hiring managers perspective.
                        The current process of hiring does not offer a crystal ball nor a good analysis from candidate to
                        candidate. The consequences of not hiring good talent, vs hiring bad candidates can cause the
                        business entity to fail. Thus, employers face a dilemma that modern platforms do not solve.
                        These problems have existed for thousands of years. Finally, there is a solution.

                        The KnocScore is short for Knowledge Credibility Score. KnoC is pronounced “Knock. Although some
                        may pronounce it is Knowck. This would be correct as well. The idea is that just as there is a
                        credit score that will tell a loan officer an individual’s credit worthiness, there is an equally
                        reliable method to measure an individual’s knowldge. A credit Score abstracts
                        the individual from the capability and history. Similarly, the KnocScore abstracts unneeded bias
                        to provide a clear understanding so that business leaders can make sound decisions on fact rather
                        than unfounded belief.

                        The KnocScore may sound new, but it actually started in 2020.  Despite the repeated apparent demand,
                        it was not until 2023 that we pivoted to make it a greater focus of our effort. The KnocScore’s
                        predecessor was built for TopScholars.co. The software had a built-in system that assessed
                        students as they learned. In a more limited fashion, we were able to provide college students
                        with our first KnocScore. It offered to increase a college students hireability. They could
                        stand out through their metrics in ways that traditional credentials did not offer. To prove
                        that the KnocScore would be effective, we interviewed 20 hiring managers. We started with friends,
                        but to get data that was not biased due to our relationship with them, we interviewed people in
                        other offices. Our first survey/interview was with a Bank Manager who was hiring college students.
                        We had a quick discussion, and he was excited about the KnocScore. Then, he asked how if he could
                        get a KnocScore for himself. I did not have an answer at that time. Surprisingly, we had a similar
                        response from every other person we talked to. Who would not

                        want a shortcut to improve their
                        status in the work force and show off their knowledge and work ethic? Although we frequently hear
                        “this is brilliant”, it does not change what we think about what we do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are on a mission to level the playing field. People should not get a job because of the color
                        of their skin, their nationality, race, nor sex. Despite what people say, these biases creep
                        into our decisions. Serious business owners need a way to abstract such bias.  We need people
                        who can do what we hire them to do. People with excellent work values. People who are smart and
                        willing to find solutions to the tough questions. These biases only make us divisive. When these
                        decisions are abstracted, we believe the decision are fair.  If we get the position or promotion
                        through a questionable decision, it undermines our ability to work. Like the winner of a marathon
                        race. There is no opinion. The winner is the one who crosses the finish line first. Similarly,
                        KnocScore is a fair assessment because it has no opinion. The results are unquestionable. An
                        individual earns their score. Full Stop!

                    <p>
                        Economic principals are key concepts to the KnocScore. Firstly, there is a cost through a scarce
                        resource. This can be through a measurement of the exchange of money or through a cost to someone's
                        actual reputation. Conversely, systems that offer badges with no measurement, nor clarity to how
                        it was earned are no more meaningful than a like on Facebook. Although there is meaning in a vote.
                        The voter did not lose credibility, nor did it cost anything for them to click the mouse. To earn
                        a KnocScore there is a cost in some form making points scarce. Secondly is the idea of demand. For
                        one individual to give up a scarce resource, there must be a reason to do so. This creates
                        pressure, or demand, for the knowledge that an individual has earned. The exchange of the scarce
                        resource is proof of its’ value. Although these are not the only metrics involved, they are key.

                        The term ‘Gold Stanard’ is defined in <a href=https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/gold-standard>The Britannica Dictionary</a>
                        as “something that is considered to be the best and that is used to judge the quality or level
                        of other, similar things”.  The KnocScore upholds to these qualities. It provides a system that
                        is consistent, transparent, self-correcting, and concrete. The scores are derived in such a way

                        that they are considered absolute meaning that they are unchangeable, difficult to foil, and free
                        of bias and error. It upholds to academic and industry scrutiny as near perfectly as possible
                        and surpasses any other method for a measure of an individual or entities knowledge credibility.
                        In this way, two individuals from different backgrounds or even universities may be viewed in an
                        apples-to-apples comparison.
