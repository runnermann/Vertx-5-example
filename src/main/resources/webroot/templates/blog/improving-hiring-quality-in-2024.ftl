                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In today's competitive marketplace, enhancing a company's bottom line is challenging and heavily
                        reliant on the employees who drive it. Their expertise, experience, problem-solving abilities,
                        and work ethic are crucial for making an impact. The infrastructure of employees is fundamental
                        to a company's success. Young companies with the right talent can overcome challenges posed by
                        larger incumbents, while established companies must hire young talent to maintain their dominance.
                        Finding candidates who can exponentially accelerate growth is invaluable, while poor hires can
                        be detrimental, poisoning teams, creating hostile environments, and costing time and money in
                        legal battles and lost reputation. Remember the adage: "It takes 10 years to build a good
                        reputation and 30 seconds to lose it." Hiring the right people cannot be overstated.
                        <a href=https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/future-of-recruiting?trk=jnt-mmnt-bl-po-q3fy24#quality-of-hire >An article from LinkedIn</a>
                        states that 54% of recruiters believe "Quality of hire" is a top issue that will
                        shape recruitment over the next five years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To solve hiring challenges in 2024, a robust hiring process is essential. Resumes and interviews
                        often fall short, leaving employers
                        uncertain about a candidate's true abilities. Recommendations from trusted sources are valuable,
                        but what about recent graduates and those with little or no industry experience? A method
                        offering better insight into a candidate's potential, akin to how a credit score assesses a loan
                        applicant's ability to repay a loan, would be invaluable. This is where our latest patent-pending
                        innovation,
                        <a href=/articles/the-knowledge-credibility-score>The Knowledge Credibility Score™</a> or simply
                        KnocScore™, comes in.

                    <p>
                        This article discusses some of the problems employers face in today’s hiring environment with
                        the top problem being applicant self-embellishment. Modern job platforms do not solve this
                        critical problem. We will discuss how KnocScore addresses this issue and solves the challenge of
                        finding and selecting highly qualified individuals.

                    <h2>Based on feedback from hiring managers, it is clear that the KnocScore&trade; has the promise to
                        revolutionize the hiring process. </h2>
                    <p>
                        In the spring of 2023, we shared our new approach with hiring managers and friends at various
                        organizations. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Hiring managers not only expressed
                        interest in early access to a list of quality candidates but also wanted to earn a KnocScore for
                        themselves. It became clear that this capability has the potential to revolutionize the hiring
                        process. Although at the time we did not have a solution for business professionals which resulted
                        in one of the hiring managers telling us to come back when he could have one too. The KnocScore
                        was for college graduates. Since then, we’ve developed a patent pending solution that satisfies
                        their request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <a href=/articles/knowledge-credibility-score> KnocScore</a> provides employers with a concrete
                        understanding of a candidate's knowledge, skills, and some metrics that give deeper insight into
                        a candidates' character. This assessment goes beyond traditional methods, highlighting a candidate's
                        work ethic and engagement with relevant information. By leveraging our innovative methods, we've
                        developed a unique solution that enables employers to fill positions with higher quality candidates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finding a perfect candidate may be impossible. The key is to recognize the candidates who will
                        adopt and acquire the skills to solve the harder challenges. In today’s world, despite the
                        promises of several popular platforms, it's still difficult and time-consuming to find good talent.

                        Job Boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, and even LinkedIn do not answer this problem. In some cases
                        they make it harder.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Searching for candidates by posting on job boards like LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed can result
                        in a high number of applications. As an
                        <a href=https://www.indeed.com/lead/driving-quality-candidates-in-competitive-job-market>article on indeed</a>
                        describes, hiring managers may receive thousands of applicants but find “they aren’t the right
                        candidates for the role”. Indeed recommends redefining the job position and removing the “Nice
                        to Haves that aren’t essential on day one” so that more candidates will match the position. Then
                        consider training them to fit the role. The large volume of applicants results in a high workload
                        to filter through the applicants taking time and effort to find the right candidates. With KnocScore,
                        hiring managers can quickly filter through the applicants to find the ones who have the knowledge,
                        skills, and experience that qualifies them for the position they need to fill. The solutions they
                        offer are not through their processes. Rather the solutions are either through an AI to assist
                        in some capabilities but not in selection, or by changing information in the posts, or by changing selection
                        criteria.

                    <h2>Job Applicants embellish… A LOT! while hiring processes eliminate qualified candidates.  </h2>
                    <p>
                        Another problem hiring managers face when looking for qualified applicants is the sheer number
                        that embellish (lie) about what they’ve accomplished in their past. One article about this states that the
                        higher the degree, the more likely the applicant has added fluff. A survey we quickly found using
                        a simple query on Google stated that 73% of their responses admitted to lying during the hiring
                        process. Another found that over 80% admitted to lying. Understanding this, many larger firms traditionally use strategies
                        such as hiring based on recommendations from someone they trust, or hiring from only a handful of
                        select universities. A top-selling book “The Abundant University” authored by Micheal D. Smith
                        <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048552/the-abundant-university/>link</a> describes such
                        a process and how many graduates from lesser known universities, who may be equally qualified,
                        are never considered. In his book that is a scathing review of university practices, he primarily
                        discusses the promises of online education. In an explanation for why MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses)
                        haven’t upheld their
                        promise, he describes how employers consider graduates from online degrees to be “inferior” to
                        those who attended classes on campus. With recent findings over the past few years such as the
                        highest officer of one of the most prestigious universities, the president of Harvard,
                        violating its own ethical standards by plagiarizing one of her students work, this strategy
                        may not

                        have the desired results. The end result for this strategy is the
                        selection pool for possible candidates is much smaller, and they miss out on excellent talent.
                        Further, job candidates who lack the right alma-matter, or do not self-elaborate, miss out on better
                        jobs and opportunities.

                    <h2 class="after">The bottom line for hiring managers: KnocScore equals Better Talent, Faster Processes, and Cost
                        Savings. </h2>
                    <p>
                        The KnocScore is unquestionable data. Employers can be certain that the score is an actual
                        representation of the individual’s knowledge, experience, and skills. Not only can hiring managers
                        believe the information they are seeing, they can also reduce the processes needed to sort through
                        candidates half-truths. This speeds up their hiring processes, saves them time as well as
                        alleviates the added expenses needed for these purposes. This allows them to hire highly qualified
                        talent before another company does, and saves them money.
