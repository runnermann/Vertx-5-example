<!-- I fear it. I taste the metal in my mouth. I imagine the mountain is higher only to fool myself. It is the journey
that I dream. Not the end. Not the accolades, the wreaths nor the flower pedals. And not the reward. I raise my sword and
shield. Praise is the enemy, completion is my death.

I am just a foot soldier. I never imagined to be anything more.

Said by a centurion poet about 49bc.

                            Currently, there is no standard to assess an individual's knowledge credibility. In academia,
                            knowledge is often measured through publications, citations, peer reviews,
                            and for the students, their grades. But academia's system is opaque, has no consistency, and
                            receives much criticism. In industry, most individuals
                            have difficulty when conveying their expertise outside their current organization.

                            In the financial world, a credit Score serves as a trusted standard to evaluate an individual's
                            creditworthiness. With a good score, loan and credit institutions give favorable terms that allow
                            the individual to pursue their goals.
                            Critically, in the professional realm there is no comparable standard for assessing an individual's
                            knowledge credibility. This lack of a consistent metric results in suboptimal hiring decisions,
                            heightened skepticism, and costly, time-consuming processes. It also complicates establishing
                            trust between professionals, contributing to what is often called 'cold introductions'.

                            points are awarded based on merit, regardless of the source. As a neutral third-party standard,
                            the KnocScore ensures fairness and relevance. This allows employers to identify real talent,
                            gives individuals access to more opportunities, and professionals may establish credibility

                            Your KnocScore is shaped by your academic and career journey. Whether through education,
                            military service, or industry experience, your knowledge continues to grow over time.

                            To the right (or below) is a simplified example of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s career. Many factors
                            contribute to an individual's KnocScore, and Oppenheimer's would likely be highest in nuclear
                            physics due to his expertise. Ultimately, observers use the information to make decisions
                            based on their own criteria. Oppenheimer may be ideal for some roles, but not others—a concept
                            true in all fields of knowledge.

                            its success. Employers often struggle to assess candidates, as many tend to overstate their
                            qualifications. As a result, some roles remain vacant to avoid hiring unqualified individuals.

                        <p class="bud-body">
                            The KnocScore helps employers hire real talent by providing a reliable, objective measurement
                            of a candidate's knowledge and skills, reducing reliance on self-reported qualifications,
                            which are often inflated by candidates. This score goes beyond resumes and
                            interviews, offering deeper insights into a candidate's expertise, work ethic, and practical
                            experience. Employers can use this validated metric to identify candidates who possess the
                            necessary skills and the ability to adapt to new challenges, speeding up the hiring process
                            and improving the quality of hires.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bud-body">
                            Moreover, the KnocScore addresses common hiring problems, such as embellishment on resumes
                            and oversaturation of irrelevant applications. Unlike traditional platforms like LinkedIn or
                            job boards, where filtering through candidates is time-consuming, the KnocScore helps employers
                            quickly pinpoint those with the proven knowledge needed for a specific role. Employers are
                            given an ability to conduct an apples-to-apples comparison to see through the grey and
                            find favorable candidates. This broadens the talent pool by identifying those with actual
                            experience, academic work, and mentorship with highly recognized individuals.
                            Where academia was previously used as a qualifier based on an institutional brand, there is
                            now a "Gold Standard" to quickly determine real talent across the spectrum.

                            In essence, the KnocScore ensures employers can trust the credibility of the candidate's
                            skills, reducing hiring risks and improving overall hiring efficiency.

                            The business world can be a battlefield. While these battles are not fought with tanks and guns,
                            the stakes are still high. Companies can fail, livelihoods can be lost, or, alternatively,
                            businesses can thrive and grow from good to great. The U.S. Army's Special Forces, commonly
                            known as the Green Berets, are renowned for their excellence, largely due to their rigorous

                            that are not completed in an hour or a day.
                            Final selection isn't completed until after 56 to 95 weeks of courses and training. Most
                            businesses, however, cannot afford to wait over a year to select the right candidate. They
                            need their positions filled immediately.
