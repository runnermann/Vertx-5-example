                            <p class="center">At KnocScore, we believe there is a lot more that can be done by technology.
                                In fact, we are surprised that we are the first to bring the potential of earning
                                pay<sup>note 1</sup> and the power of earning stats for actual learning. KnocScore was built out of
                                frustration with other systems that give little or no credit and are less focused on
                                learning and more focused on their profits. Our platform is not only about learning
                                and studying, it pays students tutors and educators 100%<sup>note 2</sup> of what they earn, then gives
                                them the ability to show off who they are with their Stats<sup>note 1</sup>. Stats are not grades. Stats
                                show effort and value in a specific area of study. KnocScore just released a new tool
                                that provides concrete evidence of value and effort in specific domain. Itâ€™s a tool you
                                can use to show off your capability.</p>
