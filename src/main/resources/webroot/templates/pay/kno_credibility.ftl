                    <p>
                        A credit provides banks and lending institutions
                        a risk of loaning money to a person. With a credit score, you go to the bank and ask for a loan.
                        The higher a credit score, the better the terms.
                        A KnoC&trade; Score is similar to the credit score, but for employment.
                        A Knowledge Credibility Score&trade; or KnoC&trade; Score, provides a naturally biased means to
                        attribute and show measurement of qualitative effort within a domain of
                        knowledge. One of the hardest challenges employers have is determining who to hire, and there
                        are no resources that provide a consistent and reliable measurement. A KnocScore is derived
                        from time spent creating, editing, and studying knowledge that has value. When combined with
                        a scoring system that gives credit to different types of recall strategies, will provide a concrete
                        means to show an individual's effort within a domain of knowledge. In this way, there is a reliable
                        and transparent perspective of how they will perform in the workplace.

                        a job applicants potential.</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Point 1:</b> Employers and managers have stated in interviews that one of their largest problems
                        in hiring is finding employees that: one, have good work ethics, and two, are competent and knowledgeable.
                        With the decline in the current generation's birth rates, universities have struggled with keeping
                        their enrollment numbers up and many two year institutions have shut their doors. Complaints
                        from employers are rising that they must increase the age of their candidates and require prior
                        work experience in order to vet prior candidates. Companies that do not employ these strategies
                        or have the structure and resources to vet and train new hires, suffer from inefficiencies . In
                        several interviews with hiring managers, all were in agreement that there needs to be a standardized
                        way to gain insight into an individuals capabilities and work ethics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Point 2:</b> Students who have higher ethical work standards may not score high, may fail more
                        classes, and not look as good in interviews. Additionally, some students have social anxiety
                        and place higher value in knowledge and work ethics than appearances. The students who maximize
                    </p>

                <div class="col-lg-5" col-sm-6>
                    <p> their studies and yet score poorly, or who may place a larger priority in projects related to
                        their education may not look good on paper. They may fail classes and not be given the credit
                        for the knowledge gained. In some cases, the students are redirected to another career path or
                        drop out completely. In reality, these students have gained skills that may be superior to their
                        peers. However, because of the evaluation system they do not gain credit. When these students
                        leave the institution, there is no record that bears a credible mark of what they have learned.
                        Employers that would benefit from the students in this category have no method to reach out to
                        them, and institutions may be following the more traditional path to help their graduates. Thus,
                        these students find it even harder than their peers to find employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Point 3:</b> In the classroom and at the university grades play a major role. From the outside
                        and to industry grades are considered private. They are also hard to measure against since there
                        are many inconsistencies between classrooms and institutions. Most employers do not ask what a
                        candidate's grades were while they attended the university, and many employers are hiring
                        employees that demonstrate the right knowledge set as opposed relying solely on a candidates'
                        diploma. What matters most to an employer is how well a candidate can do the job. A significant
                        part of that is how well will they persevere when the job gets tough.

                    <p>
                        Hiring managers struggle with hiring. Finding good hires and avoiding bad hires will
                        significantly help or hurt a business. Who you hire can be the difference between a highly
                        successful company, and a failed company. Understanding and gauging individuals based on grades
                        and diplomas has become less reliable in comparison with historical patterns. Understanding an
                        individual's competency and work ethics can be a more reliable indicator of their potential to
                        contribute towards the companies goals.

                    <h3>Value provides a distributed consensus of the credibility of created and edited materials. </h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many Scholarly articles on
                        Credibility Scores and Credibility Evaluation Systems. One such article <i>Credibility score
                        based multi-criteria recommender system</i> discusses criteria ratings created by collaborative
                        filtering (CF) systems and multi-criteria recommender systems for use in online video (YouTube),
                        movies (Netflix), books(Amazon) and social networks(Facebook). Filtering is based on information
                        that is collected from similar users. One criterion is the expenditure of a scarce resource on a
                        particular item. That item is matched with other similar items that have similar attributes
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-5" col-sm-6>
                    <p>
                        including the expense of a scarce resource by similar users. In this case, "Credibility can be
                        considered as a user's trust among various users" -Gupta (2020). In our case the user may be a fellow
                        student studying a similar course in either the same class or another class at a later date. It
                        may also be a hiring manager. The validity of the information is collaborated among several
                        students based on their willingness to give up a scarce resource, e.g. money. To the employer,
                        value of information provides credibility that the information an individual has studied or
                        created is valuable. It is reasonable to believe peer and non-peer students would not give up a
                        scarce resource for invaluable information. Thus, the studied information is likely related to
                        its subject and needed for the related area of studies. It is important to note that in this
                        case the value of information also accounts for students who request a refund of their scarce
                        resource if the information is not valid.  When a student creates or participates in the
                        creation of information and when other peer and non-peer students expend a resource for that
                        information, then this is concrete evidence that the student has created or edited valuable and
                        relevant information.

                    <h3>Study metrics verify the amount of time spent learning and interacting within a domain of knowledge.</h3>
                    <p>
                        A well-known author Malcom Gladwell argues in his book "Outliers" that highly successful people
                        are not born with a special skill, rather they have spent a high number of hours specializing in
                        that skill. His book has been highly criticized in regards its simplification of how 'Outliers'
                        achieve success, however both the
                        critics and Gladwell agree on a "Magic number" of 10,000 hours. The argument of 10,000 hours is
                        a rough number and there must be a relation of the amount of time this occurs in, however this
                        relation is highly accepted in the business world. The book "Outliers" is used in MBA programs and
                        advanced business degrees. As student's study, they are accumulating hours of learning and
                        interacting in domains of knowledge. Thus, time spent studying quality content within a domain of
                        knowledge can be used as a partial indicator of the individual's competence in that domain.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A system that measures the time spent in a domain of knowledge should also provide a qualitative
                        learning measurement.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Building memory, or memorialization is a key factor in learning, although it is not the only
                        factor, learning will not happen without it. There are several study strategies that are less
                        effective than others. Much time and research has gone into understanding learning and
                        memorialization. Although how the mechanics of learning actually occurs is still not fully
                        understood, there is enough evidence to indicate what are effective techniques. In several papers and
                        in particular the article <i>Investigating the testing effect: Retrieval as a characteristic of
                        effective study strategies</i>-Bae (2019) discussing the findings of a study including 338 undergraduates
                        using several methods of study compared against Free Recall and also coupled with Free Recall.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-5" col-sm-6>
                    <p>
                        The findings were that there was a "significant interaction between learning condition
                        (repeated vs. single retrieval practice) and type of retrieval-based strategy. Free recall and
                        practice quizzing were the most effective types of retrieval practice, and coupling test
                        generation and practice quizzing with free recall led to significant benefits in performance."
                        Significant improvements were seen when students wrote quiz questions, testing themselves
                        using free recall, and repeated the test at least once some period of time later. The study
                        used 7 days. The most common study strategy used by students is to take notes in class, pull
                        them out before a quiz, and then reread the notes during a "cram" session just prior to a major
                        exam. The paper identifies that the type of recall that is built with the common strategy relies on
                        an association or hint. When the student is posed with a question that provides no hints,
                        the student doesn't recall the answer. Students who rehearse using only multiple
                        choice and true or false questions also do not create as strong of bindings, although from our
                        metrics we see that when asked differently from the expected information can be effective.
                        However, simply scrolling through a quiz seeing the same multiple choice and T-F questions
                        repeatedly loses its effectiveness. Free recall questions creates strong memory bindings.
                        A qualitative measurement that prefers stronger recall can be accomplished using a variable
                        scoring system that prefers free-recall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the above. Value can indicate that the information that is studied provides verification
                        that the information is relevant and necessary to a domain. Time spent learning and
                        interacting with that knowledge is a partial indicator of competency. Further, a
                        scoring system that indicates an individual's understanding and memorization may also measure the
                        use of study strategies that are more effective. We can combine
                        this into an easily accessible and visual display that may be included in a reference such as a
                        C.V. or resume. The display shows the value that an individual has earned within a domain, it
                        provides a display of time spent in a domain that is divided into creation of knowledge,
                        and retrieval. And a third area is provided that displays a scoring that prefers free-recall.

                    <h2><b>Non-Solutions: The problem with Blockchain and Badging for Knowledge Credibility</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        There is a common misunderstanding about credentialing for education.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a> does not indicate
                        an individual's competence. Blockchain is an immutable ledger of transactions. It's technologies
                        help to establish that information has not changed but does not establish the quality nor validity
                        of the information itself. It does not establish that information was learned, that information
                        was relevant, nor that information was accurate. It does not guarantee that an institution's policies
                        or that a proctor's methods made individual A competent within a knowledge domain. It does not
                        guarantee that students of institution A or proctor A are more or less competent to the students
                        of institution B or proctor B.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-5" col-sm-6>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain does not establish a value to the information, nor does it provide transparency in
                        student evaluations. When hiring candidates, blockchain would not provide any meaning for this problem.
                        In the same way, badging that does not use a concrete, transparent, and equal evaluation system,
                        bears exactly the problems that the KnocScore is solving.
