                    <h3>Announcement Feb 1, 2024</h3>
                    <p>This feature will remain available due to its importance to the KnocScore
                        and the ability for students and educators to support themselves.
                        Changes to the KnocScore will also provide alternate methods to prove
                        value for learning materials.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>KnocScore employs trust from transparency and value from feedback. Thus, if a college student
                        allows shared distribution; a deck that is placed in the ecosystem can be reviewed, edited, and
                        redistributed by the buying college student. The value of a deck will increase by the size of its
                        content, type of content, reviews, number of sales, and the number of cycles. The theory is
                        there is value from quality information that is specific, relevant, and rated by known peers. A deck
                        is edited and checked for accuracy, clarity, and relevance by its users as well as receiving
                        ratings. Thus, if transparency exists from the feedback and usage of those who've purchased it,
                        its value and earnings will increase over time.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">How it works example</h2>
                    <p> <b>Zach</b> and Caleb are in Professor Haung's Class. Dr. Haung is a brilliant in his field,
                        but is often confusing to his students because his lectures are fast. There are a lot of complex concepts to cover in a short period.
                        Zach is taking notes and creating learning content that is similar to flashcards, but far more
                        advanced. He is able to capture sections of the lectures, capture images from
                        the white board, and take notes at the pace of Dr. Haung's lectures. He creates math-cards
                        using the internal calculator, so he may retain what Dr. Haung has taught. He creates note-cards
                        that contain photos and video, and he creates specialized cards that apply to the course.
                        Thus, he can apply the knowledge from the class to solve the harder problems Dr. Haung has assigned,
                        then use them to memorize or search while taking later courses, exams, or in his career.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Caleb</b> is struggling in the class and has schedule problems, but his degree requires the course. Caleb and Zach are
                        connected in social media, and Zach posts a note on the lecture hall about his Algebra Deck. Caleb sees the post.
                        Snaps the QR-Code or clicks the link in social media and downloads the deck. Caleb, not wanting to fail the course,
                        purchases the deck. Zach made 100% of the sale to Caleb and the following Friday the money is deposited into his account.</p>
                    <p>While studying the deck. Caleb makes some edits and corrects some misunderstandings he has. Caleb has three friends
                        that are also struggling in the class. Caleb posts a link in social media. The class is critical to his friends'
                        degrees, and they cannot afford to fail. They see Caleb's post and download the deck. Caleb who made some edits,
                        received 40% from the sales. Zach who does not know Caleb's three friends made 60% from them.</p>

                    <h3>Schedule</h3>
                    <h4>Fall 2022</h4>
                    <p>One of Caleb's friends, Abdul, posts that he has a deck for Professor Haung's Course. Now Abdul's friends download
                        the deck, make some corrections for the new version of the course, and the pattern repeats. The deck created by Zach
                        was edited several times giving it greater curated and reviewed content from parties motivated by their own best
                        interests. The value of the deck has increased as it provides reviewed, searchable, and accurate content. Zach,
                        the original creator receives 60% of the purchases, and Abdul receives 40%.</p>
                    <h4>Spring 2024</h4>
                    <p>Zach enjoys a Spring Break vacation in the Bahama's using his earnings from the decks he created and edited in KnocScore.</p>
                    <h4>Fall 2024</h4>
                    <p>Zach is job hunting and has several interviews and job offers. The hiring agencies and staff of each company have a few good
                        candidates, and it was hard to make a decision. Zach went the extra mile in his studies. This demonstrated that Zach
                        took the initiative to create learning content from his knowledge and earned money from them. This is a concrete indicator
                        that Zach's knowledge has value, and is a solid sign of good work ethics that employers seek. </p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Summary</h2>
                    <p>Zach created a study deck for a section of Dr. Haung's course and earned cash from the first semester. His earnings grew
                        over time. Because he was the original creator, and he started with good study materials, in theory the deck continued
                        to be passed on and Zach earned long after he created the deck. Zach, now had a resource he could access. In his later
                        courses and later in his career, when Zach needed a refresher, he could search for it in the study materials that he created.</p>
                    <p>Caleb and Abdul were able to quickly earn cash when they edited the deck and shared it with their class peers.</p>
