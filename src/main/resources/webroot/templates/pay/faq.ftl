                    <h3>Making money on KnocScore</h3>
                        <h4>What you earn is yours.</h4>
                        <p>We may have started in the Silicon Valley, but this doesn't mean our pricing strategy is the same as other
                            SV companies. In the same spirit that has helped our world become more balanced for
                            all, KnocScore is a believer in Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" where producers and consumers benefit
                            from pursuing their own best interests in a free trade system.
                            As a student or an educator you can earn an income on our platform for the hard work you already do.
                            We are transparent in our costs. KnocScore is intent on providing true value. As a learner, you get higher
                            quality materials. As a creator, you receive the reward you earn. Now the market shall be led as if by
                            an invisible hand. Sound familiar?
                        </p>
                        <p >There are several ways to make money in our ecosystem. As an original creator you
                            create a quality deck and you are paid when it sells.</p>
                        <p >If as the original creator, you allow others to share your deck. Then when they edit it
                            they may share it in their network. When they make a sale, both the original creator and the next
                            person share the sale. Thus as an original creator you receive a larger number of sales as the deck is
                            redistributed from each person. And in theory the deck's learning materials improve in accuracy, and
                            remain relevant. A deck that has been purchased and edited several times is more likely
                            to be of greater value. </p>
                        <p >As a purchaser, if the original creator allows you to "redistribute" the deck,
                            and you edit the deck for quality and relevance, then you can share the deck with your network either
                            through social media or by physically posting the address where a fellow student may obtain the
                            deck. When the deck sells, you share the sale with the original creator.</p>
                        <p >There will be more ways to earn income in the future as we make future releases.</p>

                    <h3>What can I study on KnocScore?</h3>
                    <p >KnocScore can be used for any subject in principle. No limits to the choice of academic areas!
                        Whether you are an engineer, a biologist or a historian, KnocScore is there to help with your specific topic
                        or discipline. Other possible, but not only, subjects are mathematics, computer science, chemistry, physics, law,
                        arts, languages, philosophy, anthropology and many more.</p>
                    <p >KnocScore has the smart tech for keeping up with your lectures.
                        If you're a savvy student, and like to take video's and snapshots of the math problem on the white board, then
                        you know how cumbersome it is to keep track of all of the photos, keep up with the lecture, and keep everything organized.
                        Fortunately, with KnocScore you can quickly take that snapshot, place it in a card, and use it right away. Then later,
                        when your studying, everything is in one place.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Does KnocScore have math learning tools?</h3>
                    <p >Current beta-version contains a math card that is under development. The math card allows you to insert a formula
                        similar to what you can do with TI-86 (i.e. programmable graphic calculator by Texas Instruments). When you are studying,
                        it will help to identify and correct mistakes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Can KnocScore be used for teaching?</h3>
                    <p >KnocScore's tools can be instrumental in teaching and designing courses. Courses can be divided into sections,
                        and sections can be further split into shorter segments. A segment allows you to organize smaller parts of your work: it can be
                        just one card containing a video lecture or questions for a seminar. A section can include larger portions of study materials,
                        such as modules, assignments and tests among others, which maybe be used for in-class, distant or blended teaching. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>If I created the materials, who owns them?</h3>
                    <p >We created KnocScore for educators and students following a fundamental academic rule that ideas and information
                        belong to their creators. The author owns what they create, and is responsible for the proper acknowledgement of the original source.
                        In academia, this gives credibility to the content, encourages creativity through ownership, and grants acknowledgement to the originator.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>I don't always have strong internet. Does KnocScore require a connection?</h3>
                    <p >Using websites that must be tied to the internet all the time is a bummer. KnocScore is an application that can run on and offline.
                        When you are connected, your study materials are synchronized in the cloud and you can access them from multiple devices.
                        When you are not connected, the app is still fully functional. It is possible to use KnocScore without
                        ever being connected to the internet. With KnocScore, you can study or modify your materials,
                        from anywhere without the inconvenience of that ball and chain. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What about compatibility?</h3>
                    <p >The current version is compatible with devices that run Java. Testing is conducted on Macintosh/Apple OS, and Windows OS.
                        This is generally all Windows and Apple laptops, and some tablets. Not all in app features are currently available on
                        Apple OS Ventura 13.x, but work perfectly in prior versions. Windows devices behave beautifully in Windows 11.</p>
                    <h3>When will you be available on phones?</h3>
                    <p>We get this question occasionally. Our response is, when it makes since to write papers and take class notes on a phone. KnocScore is
                        compatible with Windows Tablet devices.</p>
