                        Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting FlashMonkey customer support at https://www.FlashMonkeygames.com/customer-service. But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by customer support. This Section explains how You and FlashMonkey agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.

                        Arbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court. Any dispute between You and FlashMonkey is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution. Arbitration is more efficient for both you and FlashMonkey.

                        If you have an issue that we can’t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and FlashMonkey agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties. You and FlashMonkey agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution"). Those informal negotiations will start on the day You or FlashMonkey receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with this Agreement.

                        You and FlashMonkey agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS") subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules") as modified by this Agreement.

                    <p>
                        This means that You and FlashMonkey agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute. JAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and FlashMonkey resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court. The arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.

                        12.3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        You agree to submit all Disputes between You and FlashMonkey to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and FlashMonkey that relates to your use or attempted use of FlashMonkey’s products or services and FlashMonkey’s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small-claims court; (2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (3) a complaint or remedy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation; (4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (5) FlashMonkey’s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats, and intellectual-property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You and FlashMonkey agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under this Agreement will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.

                        12.3.2 Arbitration Procedure:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        To start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website. The party starting an arbitration must must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration" (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. You will send a copy to FlashMonkey Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. FlashMonkey will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes. You and FlashMonkey both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in San Jose California.
                        The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless You and FlashMonkey agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or FlashMonkey to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator may not award relief against FlashMonkey respecting any person other than You.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.
                    </p>

                        12.3.4 Notice and Filing. If a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or FlashMonkey must start arbitration of the Dispute within 1 year from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. FlashMonkey encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.

                        If all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and FlashMonkey agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of the agreement shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and FlashMonkey agree that it will not be severable; this entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in this Agreement. Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without FlashMonkey’s express consent.
